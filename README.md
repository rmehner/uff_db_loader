# UffDbLoader

## Description

`uff_db_loader` provides rake tasks to download and import databases in rails projects with a dockerized deployment that we use in multiple projects.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'uff_db_loader'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install uff_db_loader

## Configuration

You can configure the gem by running the following during the initialization of the Rails app:
```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

UffDbLoader.configure do |config|
  config.environments = ['sandbox', 'production'] # default is "['staging', 'production']"
  config.ssh_user = 'Francina'
  config.ssh_host = 'host.of.yoursite'
  config.db_name = 'twotter'
  config.db_system = :postgresql # Possible values are 'postgresql' and 'mysql'.
  config.app_name = 'my_app' # Defaults to the Rails app name
  config.dumps_directory = '/path/to/dumps' # Defaults to Rails.root.join('dumps')
  config.database_config_file = 'path/to/database.yml' # Defaults to Rails.root.join('config', 'database.yml')
end
```
For example in a file like `config/initializers/uff_db_loader.rb`.

Make sure the app's database user has the superuser role. Otherwise the app will crash on startup due to missing permissions.

If you're using mysql be sure to set the proper `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable.

## Usage

`uff_db_loader` provides `rails remote_database:dump` and `rails remote_database:load` which will prompt for a configured environment.
`dump` will only create and download a current database dump, while `load`, will do the same and restore the database content into a new database and gives instructions on how to use it in development.
